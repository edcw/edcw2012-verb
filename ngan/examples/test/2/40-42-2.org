I was very happy in this summer vacation.
Because I like to travel, so I traveled to a lot of places.
I went to Okayama, Hiroshima, Shiga, Ehime and Tokyo.
My friends live these places.
I played with my friends.
Tokyo is very noisy, but very interesting.
Shiga's lake is very large.
Ehime's orange is very delicious.
Himeji is very country, but this place lives a lot of my friends.
I had a good time.
And University students do not have homework.
So I do not study in this summer vacation.
I do not want to study forever!
