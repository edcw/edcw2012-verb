I was very happy in this summer vacation.
Because I like to travel, <con crr="">so</con> I traveled to a lot of places.
I went to Okayama, Hiroshima, Shiga, Ehime and Tokyo.
My friends live <prp crr="in"></prp> these places.
I played with my friends.
Tokyo is very noisy, but very interesting.
Shiga's lake is very large.
Ehime's <n_num crr="oranges">orange</n_num> <v_agr crr="are" ch="1">is</v_agr> very delicious.
Himeji is very <aj crr="rural">country</aj>, but <prp crr="in"></prp> this place <v_agr crr="live">lives</v_agr> a lot of my friends.
I had a good time.
And University students do not have homework.
So I <v_tns crr="didn't study">do not study</v_tns> in this summer vacation.
I do not want to study forever!
