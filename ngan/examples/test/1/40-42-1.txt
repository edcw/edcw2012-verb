I'm a student.
I go to school everyday.
This school's name is Konan University.
I live in Himeji.
So when I go to university, I'm very sleepy everyday.
University's study is very difficult.
I took part in <at crr="a"></at> tennis circle, but I <v_tns crr="stopped">stop</v_tns> to go <prp crr="" ch="4">to</prp> <av crr="there">it</av>.
Because it costs very <av crr="much">hard</av>!
My <n_lxc crr="part time workplace">albite</n_lxc> is <at crr="a"></at> cycle stop in JUSCCO.
This work is very easy and <aj crr="enjoyable">enjoy</aj>.
It's a good job!
I like to listen to music, to read books, to play kendo and to travel.
Especially I like to travel very much.
I traveled to Okayama, Hiroshima, Ehime, Shiga and Tokyo in this summer vacation.
My old and new friends live in these places.
I had a good time.
