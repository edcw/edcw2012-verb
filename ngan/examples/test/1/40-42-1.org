I'm a student.
I go to school everyday.
This school's name is Konan University.
I live in Himeji.
So when I go to university, I'm very sleepy everyday.
University's study is very difficult.
I took part in tennis circle, but I stop to go to it.
Because it costs very hard!
My albite is cycle stop in JUSCCO.
This work is very easy and enjoy.
It's a good job!
I like to listen to music, to read books, to play kendo and to travel.
Especially I like to travel very much. 
I traveled to Okayama, Hiroshima, Ehime, Shiga and Tokyo in this summer vacation.
My old and new friends live in these places.
I had a good time.
