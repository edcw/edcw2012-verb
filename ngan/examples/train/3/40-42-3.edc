First I don't know gardening.
I can't plant flowers and to say flower's name.
I know flower's name "rose", "himawari", "asagao", "tyurip" and "tanpopo".
But I have a friend that knows gardening very well.
He works to the flowershop.
He loves flowers.
Flowers is very beautiful.
I think that it was relaxed to people.
So I think that I know about flowers.
I want to be flower's pro...it's a joke.
