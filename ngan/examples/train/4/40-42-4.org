My hobby is to play kendo, to play computer games, and to read books.
I had practiced for ten years.
I like to play kendo, because I can to enjoy it.
But kendo is very smell.
I like to play game.
Especially I like "FF", "FE",and "CT".
They are very good games!
I love to read books.
I read two books every day.
Books give many knowledge to us.
But books are expensive.
So I run out my money soon.
Oh, My God!!
